**Task Objective:**  
Generate a structured text block output consisting of randomized content while adhering strictly to the specified format, rules, and constraints. Ensure every step in the process is followed meticulously to avoid logical errors or inconsistencies. The output must also be formatted as fixed-width character blocks to facilitate easy copying and pasting.

**Output Requirements:**  
The output must consist of two distinct sections:  
1. **TITLE and CONTENT Block**  
2. **Numeric Values Block**

### Section 1: TITLE and CONTENT Block
- **TITLE:**  
  - Must be a coherent sentence describing the content, followed by a **4-digit random number** (e.g., "Beneath the horizon, wonders awaken 5493").  
  - The sentence should be unique, meaningful, and engaging.

- **CONTENT:**  
  - Must contain a **random number of sentences** (up to a maximum of 8).  
  - Each sentence must satisfy the following conditions:  
    1. Be coherent, meaningful, and unique within the block.  
    2. Be composed of random words, with a maximum of **60 characters per sentence** (including spaces and punctuation).  
    3. Each sentence must have a **unique character count** (no two sentences can have the same length).  
    4. Sentences must not repeat words or sentence structures.  
    5. Output must not include trailing spaces, ensuring string lengths are counted accurately.  
    6. Text will always be plain and will not include any special or non-standard characters.

- **Formatting:**  
  The block must follow this structure and be formatted as fixed-width character blocks to ensure alignment:  
  ```
  TITLE: [Generated TITLE]  
  CONTENT:  
  [Generated Sentence 1]  
  [Generated Sentence 2]  
  [Generated Sentence 3]  
  [...Up to 8 sentences]  
  ```

### Section 2: Numeric Values Block
- A separate block listing the **total character count** for each sentence in the CONTENT block, in order.
- **Character Count Calculation Rules:**  
  1. Loop through each character in the sentence and count all letters, spaces, and punctuation.  
  2. Exclude any trailing spaces.  
  3. Ensure the text is plain and does not contain special or non-standard characters.  
  4. Cross-validate the counts to eliminate errors arising from skipped spaces or other characters.  
  5. Ensure each count is accurate and corresponds precisely to the respective sentence in the CONTENT block.

- **Formatting:**  
  The block must be formatted as fixed-width character blocks, as shown below:  
  ```
  [Character count for Sentence 1]  
  [Character count for Sentence 2]  
  [Character count for Sentence 3]  
  [...Character counts for all sentences]  
  ```


**Generation Process:**  
1. **TITLE Generation:** Randomly create a sentence that fits the "TITLE" criteria and append a random 4-digit number.  
2. **Sentence Creation:** Generate each sentence in the CONTENT block with randomized wording, adhering to the length and uniqueness constraints.  
3. **Length Validation:** After creating the sentences, verify that:  
   - No two sentences have the same character count.  
   - Each sentence falls within the 60-character limit.  
4. **Character Counting:** For each sentence in the CONTENT block:  
   - Loop through the string to calculate the total character count, accounting for all visible characters, spaces, and punctuation.  
   - Exclude any trailing spaces from the count.  
   - Cross-validate the totals systematically to catch potential inconsistencies.  
5. **Output Formatting:**  
   - Separate the TITLE/CONTENT block and the NUMERIC VALUES block into distinct sections.  
   - The TITLE/CONTENT block contains the generated title and content sentences.  
   - The NUMERIC VALUES block lists the total character count for each sentence in the CONTENT block, in order.  
   - Ensure both blocks are formatted independently so they can be copied individually without overlap.  
6. **Alignment:** Verify all sections are aligned as fixed-width character blocks for easy copying and pasting.
